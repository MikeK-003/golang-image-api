# golang-image-api

This repo contains the source code for a serverless API I have made with AWS.

The API has 3 parts: AWS Lambda, a S3 Bucket, and an API Gateway trigger for the Lambda function.

Final API Gateway trigger endpoint: https://52dzs50o5i.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/golang-image-api
